Group C is composed of the majority at 460 employees. Groups A and B make up 4% of employees at 20 employees each, which happens to mirror the Canadian population. At a glance, representation seems equal.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, if you take a closer look at how the 20 employees from group A and B are distributed across salary levels, a different story appears. Group A is equally distributed among salary level, but the majority of group B employees remain at the lowest salary levels.\n\n\n\nsalary Scaffold\n\n\nCalculating DI further illustrates the differences in salary distribution. Above a DI of 1, a group’s representation at a salary level is higher than the average of all employees. Below a DI of 1, a group’s representation at a salary level is lower than the average of all employees"

    "text": "In 2021, the Canadian Privy Council Clerk made a Call to Action on Anti-Racism, Equity, and Inclusion, urging the Government of Canada to take action against the effects of racism and discrimination within the Canadian Public Service. In particular, the call to action recommends that specific and targeted measures be taken to address the lack of diverse leadership. This analysis addresses one of the Privy Clerk’s recommended actions, which is to:\n“[Measure] progress and [drive] improvements in the employee workplace experience by monitoring disaggregated survey results and related operational data (for example, promotion and mobility rates, tenure)…” (sic)\n\n\nThe Non-Visible Minority (non-VM) category contains data from any employee who has not self-identified as a visible minority.\nA few caveats are that it is possible that this category includes: - employees who are visible minorities that have chosen not to self-identify - members of other equity deserving groups.\nIn 2022, this group made up approximately 85% of all core Public Service employees.\n\n\n\nIndigenous employees are not included in the VM group. Due to the Employment Equity Act’s classifications of the group, Indigenous employees’ data is collected separately from the VM group.\n\n\n\nYes, Black employees are a subset of the VM group.\n\n\n\nTo examine the effects of covariates, the Disproportionality Index (DI) would be need to be calculated directly from microdata (individual data) rather than aggregated counts, which is what is available on the Treasury Board site. This microdata contains personal and confidential information, and must be handled by personnel with the required security clearance. We highly recommend that DI be calculated on the complete and original dataset.\nThe Treasury Board reports data on employee: * Location * Occupational group/category * Number of executives * Salary * Age * Tenure * Language\nDepending on data linkages and format, it could be possible to quantify the effects of these covariates.\n\n\n\nAs with the previous question, to quantify uncertainty and determine the statistical significance of the differences between groups, the Disproportionality Index (DI) would be need to be calculated directly from microdata, which is what is available on the Treasury Board site. This microdata contains personal and confidential information, and must be handled by personnel with the required security clearance. We highly recommend that DI be calculated on the complete and original dataset.\n\n\n\nThe Employment Equity Act and the concept of Equality at large in Canada operates within the legal framework of equal outcomes, which means that employers have an obligation to ensure that employees success is not dependent on their race, gender, or any other factor related to the designated employment equity groups. This data illustrates that equal outcomes are not being achieved in the core Public Service, and therefore we defer to the recommendations outlined in the Privy Council Clerk’s Call to Action on Anti-Racism, Equity, and Inclusion in the Federal Public Service for further action on resolving the career marginalization that Black public servants face."

This data is particularly interesting as it is disaggregated, meaning that additional questions to used identify subgroups within the equity-deserving groups were included in the survey. Therefore, when information about the visible minority group is presented, Black employees (but not Indigenous employees) are included.\nPlease note that this data was imputed for suppressed numbers (see here for more information)."
